                                In April of 2022, Shanghai entered a prolonging period of lockdown. It wasn't claimed to be lasting for long, and citizens entered the period unprepared.<br><br>
                                
                                As days passed, breaking down of supply chain, medical resources and overall changes in everyday lives put people's state of minds at danger. Deaths, confrontations, and hugely suppressed emotions accumulated, and an online rally of spreading information against censorship took place. I thought I needed to react and go to the front line as a photographer, yet that was physically impossible.<br><br>
                                
                                On April 25th I decided that I could at least experience the bodily sensations of volunteers in Shanghai. So I started to go anywhere in a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) from China, the same equipment of some health workers.<br><br>
                                
                                PPE immediately changed the way I interact with the world, and I tried to document those changes through diary and photographs. I felt isolated from the outer world, even from normal access of air and light. The way people interacted with me also changed vastly.<br><br>
                                
                                I took off the PPE on the day lockdown ended on June 30th. People in Shanghai were told that the lockdown was pure voluntarily, not by government orders.<br><br>
                                
                                Foggy, Sometimes Sunny consists of photos that I took across the foggy eyepiece caused by my breath and sweating, and photos my friends took of me. I hope to break the stereotypes connected to the symbolic look of PPE.
