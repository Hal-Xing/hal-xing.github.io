                                In April 2022, Shanghai entered an unexpected and prolonged lockdown. With little warning, people were caught off guard—physically, mentally, emotionally.<br><br>
                                
                                As days went by, breakdowns in food supply, healthcare, and daily routines pushed many to a breaking point. Online, people began sharing censored information. I wanted to document what was happening—but from Tokyo, I couldn't be there.<br><br>
                                
                                On April 25th, I started wearing a full PPE suit from China in my daily life. It wasn't just about subverting the symbol—I wanted to physically understand what isolation, protection, and being seen as a symbol felt like.<br><br>
                                
                                Inside the suit, the world shifted. Air and light became distant. Strangers reacted differently. I documented it all—in diary entries, photos, through fogged lenses and fleeting sensations.<br><br>
                                
                                I took the suit off when lockdown officially ended on June 30th. The government claimed it had never been mandatory.<br><br>
                                
                                Foggy, Sometimes Sunny is a collection of those images—some taken by me, some by my partner.
